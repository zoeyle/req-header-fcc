This is a request header parser microservice, a back-end practice project. It retrieves client's IP address, language and operating system information then show it to the client in front-end.

When client click on `show me the truth` button, the file `public/client.js` uses jQuery to make a GET request to `server.js` and retrieves needed information into variable `toRet` and show it on the page by altering one of the HTML element in `views/index.html` with id = show.
